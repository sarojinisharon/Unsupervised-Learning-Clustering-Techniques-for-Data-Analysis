# Unsupervised Learning: Clustering Techniques for Data Analysis  

This project delves into clustering, a core unsupervised learning technique, to group data points based on inherent similarities. Various clustering algorithms are applied to datasets to identify patterns and meaningful structures without labeled data.

## **Project Overview**  

1. **Clustering Techniques**  
   - **K-Means Clustering:** Partitions data into a predefined number of clusters using centroid minimization.  
   - **Hierarchical Clustering:** Forms a dendrogram to group similar points hierarchically.  
   - **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering):** Groups points based on density and separates noise.  

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values and normalized data to improve clustering accuracy.  

3. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   - Silhouette scores to assess cluster quality.  
   - Visualization techniques (e.g., scatter plots) to understand cluster distribution.

## **Key Learnings**  

- **K-Means:** Effective for well-separated, spherical clusters but requires specifying the number of clusters.  
- **Hierarchical Clustering:** Useful for visualizing relationships between clusters but computationally expensive for large datasets.  
- **DBSCAN:** Handles noisy data well and discovers clusters of arbitrary shapes.
